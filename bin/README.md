# Binaries

This binary has been built on an Orange Pi Zero but should work on other
ARMv7 devices.

```sh
$ uname -srmo
Linux 6.1.63-current-sunxi armv7l GNU/Linux
```

I've been too lazy to make proper packages for distribution, and this is
here mostly as an easy way to import the executable into an OS image
being built for the
[Orange Pi Zero GPS NTP Server](https://github.com/moonbuggy/Orange-Pi-Zero-GPS-NTP)
project.
